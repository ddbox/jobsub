* Feature 12244 new url type: tardir://(path/to/some_directory) .  When this
                url is encountered during job submission, create a tar file 
                some_directory.tar in the cwd, and upload it to the dropbox
                as if the dropbox://some_directory.tar url had been in the
                command line.  Can be used with --tar_file_name to save a
                step.  In other words: tar cvzf some_directory some_directory.tar;
                jobsub_submit --tar_file_name dropbox://some_directory.tar and
                jobsub_submit --tar_file_name tardir://some_directoy are
                equivalent.

                            --idle to see idle jobs

                    --better-analyze, or --help.
              


Server
-----

* Feature  6698     Jobsub group admin superuser capability to 
                    hold/release/remove jobs

                    to use: you must be listed in the 'group_superusers' entry
                    for that group in jobsub.ini.  Actions by superusers are 
                    logged to /var/log/jobsub/condor_superuser.log .  If you
                    have permissions then
                    
                    jobsub_hold -G some_group  --user some_user
                    will hold all of user 'some_user's jobs submitted for accounting
                    group 'some_group' .  NB --jobid also works for hold/release/remove
                    but must include --user as well for command to work.
                    

* Feature  9277     Better pre-staging of SAM jobs
                    When --dataset_definition is specified during a jobsub_submit, a diamond
                    shaped DAG is submitted.  The top node of the dag starts a SAM project.
                    Prior to this release, the top node then exited and condor started the middle
                    nodes of the dag.  If the files requested in the dataset_definition happen
                    to be on tape and not on disk, the middle node jobs would set idle waiting
                    for the data to be staged to disk.  Starting with this release, the top
                    node starts the project and waits until a sufficient number of files are
                    staged to disk, then exits.  The purpose is to keep one node idle waiting
                    for files instead of many.

* Feature 11571     Add myproxy authentication to server
                    to use: 'myproxy' must be listed in the 'authentication_methods' 
                    entry in jobsub.ini for your group, and 'myproxy_server' entry must exist 
                    and resolve to a working myproxy server.  This release, v1.2 will
                    have 'myproxy' listed in the 'test' group.  If you want to test
                    this feature get yourself added to the 'test' VO subgroup and
                    get access to cigetcert.  


* Feature 11717     job_lease_duration is now a configurable item in the jobsub.ini
                    file, and will end up in the submission JDF.

* Feature 11652     reformat submit.log so that jobsub_submit command and resulting
                    jobsubjobid are on the same output line.

* Feature 11875    voms_proxy_lifetime is now a configurable item in jobsub.ini

Client

* Bug 8664          Ungraceful handling of SIGPIPE

                    Piping longish client output through a secondary command like
                    head or more can throw ugly and difficult to understand python 
                    exception - fixed.

* Bug 9856          Clients do not look for cert in documented location

                    Inline documentation for client library incorrectly stated that
                    a default cert location /tmp/x509up_(UID) was checked for a cert.
                    The actual default location is /tmp/jobsub_x509up_(UID) and has
                    been so since jobsub v0.4.   Updated documentation and changed
                    client code to check cert for validity prior to submission.

* Bug 10263         Jobsub_q --long runs out of memory
                    
                    Output from server was handled inneficiently, causing long enough
                    return results to throw an out of memory exception - fixed.

* Bug 10269         Jobsub_fetchlog only works with KCA certs
                    Now works with any cert that resolves to a user in VOMS.

Server
-----

* Bug 9976          Jobsub_q not detecting server errors 
 
                    Jobsub_q called condor_q -g on the servers.  Condor_q -g may 
                    or may not exit with non-zero status if a schedd is not responding,
                    this appears to be a function of the order that it contacts the
                    schedds in - it returns the exit status for the  last schedd contacted.
                    Server code now contacts all of the schedds individually and exits
                    non-zero if one of the schedds does.

* Feature 11437     add units to --expected-lifetime , add warning to any input that accepts 
                    bare number wihout units. --timeout  --disk --memory do this now

                         kill user job if still running after NUMBER[UNITS] of
                         time . UNITS may be `s' for seconds (the default), `m'
                          for minutes, `h' for hours or `d' h for days.

* Bug    #10448  check jobsub_submit for proper units , exit with helpful
                 error message if following is not adhered to:

                 --disk=NUMBER[UNITS]
                          Request worker nodes have at least NUMBER[UNITS] of

                          'KB' (a typo in earlier versions  said that default
                          was 'MB', this was wrong).  Allowed values for  UNITS
                          are 'KB','MB','GB', and 'TB'
                  --memory=NUMBER[UNITS]
                          Request worker nodes have at least NUMBER[UNITS]  of
                          memory.              If UNITS is not specified default
                          is 'MB'.   Allowed values for              UNITS are
                          'KB','MB','GB', and 'TB'
                  --cpu=NUMBER        
                           request worker nodes have at least NUMBER cpus

* Feature #10715 new jobsub_submit server option --expected-lifetime

                 Expected lifetime of the job. Used to match against
                 resources advertising that they have
                 REMAINING_LIFETIME seconds left. The shorter your
                 EXPECTED_LIFTIME is, the more resources (aka slots,
                 cpus) your job can potentially match against and the
                 quicker it should start. If your job runs longer than
                 EXPECTED_LIFETIME it may be killed by the batch
                 system. If your specified EXPECTED_LIFETIME is too
                 long your job may take a long time to match against a
                 resource a sufficiently long REMAINING_LIFETIME.
                 Valid inputs for this parameter are 'short', 'medium',
                 'long', or an integer which represents
                 EXPECTED_LIFETIME in seconds. The values for
                 'short','medium',and 'long' are configurable by Grid
                 Operations, they currently are '6 hours' , '12 hours'
                 , and '24 hours' but this may change in the future.
                 Default value of EXPECTED_LIFETIME is 6 hours.)

* Feature #10727 Validate jobid on client commands
                 jobids sent to clients via --job or --jobid now are checked
                 for extra characters that do not belong and exit with useful
                 error message if detected.

* Bug #11132     Problem with jobsub_fetchlog found during testing 
* Bug #11134     Problem with jobsub_fetchlog --list found during testing


Server
-----------

* Feature #6954  Add configurable option to server for maximum number
                 of processes in one cluster.  To protect server resources
                 jobsub_submit -N is now limited to the value 

                 jobsub_max_cluster_procs = 10000
         
                 in the jobsub.ini file.  

* Feature #9671  add a Role reminder to jobsub_fetchlog error message

* Feature #10643 poms_data json data structure sent to ifdh log 

* Feature #10819 Web interface to job logs.

                 To test: load your pkcs12 cert (typically generated with
                 get-cert) into your browser.  In your browser, go to

                 https://jobsub-server-host.fnal.gov:8443/jobsub/acctgroups/

                 After the 'really grant an exception to this servers certificate'
                 hoops are passed through, A list of links to supported groups on 
                 the server will appear in the browser.  Click on the group you
                 are a member of in VOMS, other groups will give you authentication
                 errors.  Click on the 'sandboxes for completed jobs' link.
                 You will then either be able to browse your own sandbox directory
                 or all users sandbox directories depending on the setting allowing
                 this documented in Feature #10822 below.  A list of jobsub jobid
                 links should appear.  Click on one of these and a list of files
                 in the sandbox should appear.  Most of these files are now directly
                 readable in the browser.  File types that are readable are configured
                 in the jobsub.ini configuration file with the setting

                 output_files_web_browsable_allowed_types = '.list .of .extensions .out .err .etc'
             
* Feature #10822 Make it possible for all members of a group to do
                 jobsub_fetchlog of other members of the group. This is
                 a configurable option.  For all supported groups, setting
                 the jobsub.ini parameter to

                 sandbox_readable_by_group = True

               fail.  Fixed with temp files.

* Bug #10161   Check for '@' in --job specification in clients.  
               If '@'  was not present a confusing and misleading curl error was
               the result.  Now is caught,  clear error message and non zero exit
               results.

* Feature #10184  jobsub_history searchable by submission date.
               Two new flags for jobsub_history:
                  --qdate-ge  :Submission date (aka qdate) greater than or equal
                               to
                  --qdate-ld  :Submission date less than or equal to;

               Date format is 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss' or 'YYYY-MM-DD'
               Padded zeros are required on dates.


Server
--------

* Bug #10152  XML dag parsed incorrectly in some circumstances.
              Aribitrarily complicated dag specifications submitted with
              jobsub_submit_dag should now work.  See RITM0270806
        

* Bug #5526  fetchlog should return sandbox even if we specify a jobid for DAG nodes.
             Another way of stating this problem is that if a jobid can be seen with 
             jobsub_history or jobsub_q then it should work in jobsub_fetchlog to
             retrieve its information.  Formerly the jobsub_parent_id was needed for
             a DAG or a cluster with many processes.
================================================================================
v1.1.6
================================================================================
Client
-------
* Feature #7518 'jobsub' command in jobsub_client is now a help command.
                Lists all the jobsub_client commands and thier functions and
                a URL with further documentation

* Bug #9506 make getopt scream about the missing option
                Client commands are more helpful when user does not supply
                a required option

* Feature #7227 jobsub_rm new option: --forcex
                runs condor_rm --forcex, like condor_rm --forcex it will fail
                if job has not already  been removed with jobsub_rm and placed in the 
                'X' state 
                
* Feature #7102 jobsub_q new option: --better-analyze
                runs condor_q -better-analyze on specified --jobid

* Bug #9625    Error in online help said that units for --disk=<num> specified <num>MB of 
               requested disk on worker node.  It was actually <num>KB of requested
               disk.  Error in help has been corrected and option now accepts 
               --disk=<num><units> where <units> can be one of 'KB','MB','GB','TB'.  
               If <units> is not specified it defaults to 'KB' as in earlier releases. 
Server
--------
* Feature #7518 speed up jobsub_history
                condor_history files are now parsed and exctracted into a sqlite
                database, which is much faster and does not 'hang' the server like
                a condor_history to to full history logs does.  The output format 
                has changed, this will probably be tweaked.  Jobsub_history 
                --submitted-after <date> and --submitted-before <date> should run
                reasonably fast now but are not implemented in this release.

* Bug #10028 jobsub_rm --user finds no jobs to remove
                underlying hold/release/remove commands now use -pool flag
                as a workaround force correct behavior reference condor bug 
                https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=5221

* Bug #9713 --cpu flag doing the wrong thing
                --cpu <NUM> flag to require that job runs only on a worker node
                with <NUM>  available cores had a typo that would cause the job
                to never start.  This is fixed, and should work if the OSG site
                that the job lands at supports it.

* Feature #8292 add tracking to job rm/hold/release
                HoldReason/ReleaseReason/RemoveReason now lists DN and ip address
                of user that issues hold/release/rm

* Bug #9711 better logging
                Two new logs created in jobsub log area (default /var/log/jobsub/)

                submit.log shows ip address uid, and jobsub_submit 
                options of each submitted job, along with jobsubjobid if job is 
                successful and [ERROR] (error output) if job fails.  
    
                condor_commands.log shows (most) condor_commands initiated
                as a result of client commands, and and error output 
                along with [ERROR] tag
             
* Bug #7864 extra @ on job name in certain circumstances
                resulted in user jobs failing occasionally, fixed.

* Bug #8186 inconsistent behavior with -G and jobsub_q
                jobsub_q -G returned authentication errror if user
                not in that group.  This behavior was wrong, users
                should be able to query the state of the server.

* Bug #9740 jobsub_preen needs to clean up dropbox and /var/lib/jobsub
               added some cleanup areas to cron jobs.
